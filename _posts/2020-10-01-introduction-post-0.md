Hello friend! You may be asking yourself, how did I get here? What is this site? I'm here to tell you that this is my personal blog for my Introduction to Digital Humanities class, and I'll be using it to make short form scholarly posts about things I'm interested in/thinking about over the next few months. This site is very much a work in progress, but I can assure you beautification is on the way! Stick around, won't you?
