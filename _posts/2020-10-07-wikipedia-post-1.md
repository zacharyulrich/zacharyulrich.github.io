I wanted to start this blog post by talking about something near and dear to my and I'm sure many other student's hearts: Wikipedia. A tool so powerful you could have the entire knowledge of our world at your fingertips. When I was in grade school, it had gotten a pretty bad reputation for being an unreliable source of information because anyone with an internet connection could alter information on any page however they pleased, but today I have professors that openly advocate for it to be used for research purposes, along with the use as general reference for looking up definitions and other topics. Hearing this was understandably shocking, after being told for my entire educational career that I was not allowed to go anywhere near Wikipedia. I can't seem to remember when or how this shift in trust happened, so I wanted to look at how we got here. 

I'll talk about how Wikipedia works first, because I think that understanding how this tool works is key to understanding its flaws. Wikipedia is a free-to-use open source hub of information that anyone can edit. If you can think of something, there's a 99% chance that there's an article about it, containing a wealth of information that users have amassed over time. This is an incredibly powerful tool, but being able to edit any article presents a significant problem with credibility and trust when thinking about how students will read through these articles if they can be altered at any time. For example, a user with malicious intent, or perhaps attempting to make a joke by changing information 	to something that is unrelated or false could affect how the article is then found by later users, if the errors are not caught. 

I came across an article by Cullen J. Chandler when poking around trying to figure out why we don’t readily trust Wikipedia. In it, he details a class project that sought to teach students the mechanics of Wikipedia after flat-out banning the use of Wikipedia in their previous assignments. I think that this is a super interesting way to work around and understand why students and teachers alike use this site for reference constantly. The results of this experiment were very satisfying to read too, with some students having their changes featured on the home page of Wikipedia, while others were banned briefly from the site for breaching “Wikiettiquite” (Chandler, 2010), but above all the most satisfying part about this project was the author ownership the students felt towards the articles they published on Wikipedia. They poured many hours into making sure it was properly researched because they knew that it was going to be out there for the world to see, and there was a general consensus of pride about the work they had done. 

Another article I came across by Darren Crovitz suggests that Wikipedia’s malleability invites users to “question what they’re reading in ways that static, expert-driven texts do not” (2009). I think that this is a great point. When I was a kid, I was told to not trust everything I see on the internet. But I feel that, with time, I have become more trusting of information I see on the internet, because I have learned what false information and traps look like. I know to question information I see on the internet, because if I don’t, I run the risk of spreading misinformation, or worse, getting fact-checked in front of my peers and looking like an idiot. In addition to this, I feel like the advocating of students to use Wikipedia as something they are already used to, as a reference, to find more sources is absolutely the right way to use Wikipedia in the classroom. I think that above all else, we should first be teaching our students how to filter through information and spot bad information to make sure they are not only getting the right information but also getting the information from places that they trust. 

When I was first introduced to Wikipedia, I remember being astonished at just how much information there was out there. But having now grown up with it, I have also grown up with the skills to navigate the internet and figure out what information is trustworthy and what is not. In truth, I owe some of these lessons to Wikipedia and from going down rabbit holes, only to find that it dead ends to a stub article with few trustworthy sources. As a researcher though, Wikipedia is an extremely valuable tool helping to discover more information than I know what to do with, while allowing us to still question the information we are given.
