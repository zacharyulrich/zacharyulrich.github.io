Why should we visualize data? I was recently asked this in class. It was a question so simple I sort of stalled in confusion and thought a lot about it. It couldn’t be as simple as making data look pretty, right? It has to be more complex than that, right? Truth be told, we visualize data for any reason you want to visualize it. Whether it be making it pretty or making the data more accessible for others to use, data visualization is taking data and putting it into a form of display. 

We got the chance to play around with this a little during the same class at this fantastic website: rawgraphs.io. It basically takes you through a handful of example data sets and lets you play around with a bunch of different graph types. There are specific graphs for most kinds of data, meaning that some graphs work better with different types of data than others do. Of all of these, I remember being told that the pie chart is the most difficult chart to use because of how difficult it is to tell different sections from each other. It’s worth playing around to get a basic understanding of what information works where, and where you can pick out patterns from data. 

Creating these charts in class reminded me of a chart we saw a couple of weeks ago. We were shown a pretty interesting image of a graph depicting the seemingly convincing message that the spread of Coronavirus was slowing in the five most impacted counties in Georgia. Our professor shared the graph and asked us to look for what was wrong with the image, and people took a couple minutes to look it over and figure out what was wrong. At first glance, it seemed like any other graph. Colors matched their respective bars on the graph, and they all seemed to trend downward, signaling that these counties were experiencing a slower spread of COVID. But then I took a closer look at the bottom of the graph and noticed something strange: time was not displayed as linear as it often is.

Obviously, this graphic was meant to mislead the public into thinking that it was safe to reopen schools by showing a decreasing number of COVID hospitalizations, but the key question is why? Data visualization in the news, especially in a post-fact world, aims to restore the credibility of news by showing data in a transparent way that can be easily read and understood by an audience, while linking to the original sources. Kennedy says that the aim of showing these sources along with visualizations of data in the news is used to establish trust (p. 181), while also “performing transparency” (p 182). Yet with this graph, there was no clear source, and the most basic thing that everyone knows about, time, was not correct, leading the audience to call out the department that put out the graphic in the first place. 

Displaying and citing data is one thing, but interpretation is a whole new game. Objectively, there are good and bad ways to display data, but there are many more ways to interpret data. This could mean finding patterns that were not visible previously, and Drucker (2011) says that human knowledge is based on how we perceive it, lending unique interpretations to every individual. Using the graph above as an example, different people may interpret this graph as a sign that it is indeed safe to go outside again, and others may take a closer look and decide the opposite. Data visualization itself is not quite static, having many different outlets for how to display data, but interpretation of that visualization is also influenced by the viewer. 

I want to touch on one last form of data visualization. Most people think of charts or maps when thinking about visualizing data, but it can also be art. Knight (2018) says that artistic visualizations reframe canonized structures by off-centering consensus, not resolving but questioning or restructuring issues. What this essentially means is that information is questioned because of the artistic visualization itself being more abstract and difficult to decipher. By calling into question how the data is presented, the viewer can ultimately bring into question new issues that were previously not mentioned. This goes back to what I was talking about data visualization being very individually perspective-based, and artistic visualizations take this and run with it. 

Personally, I find these artistic visualizations to be far more interesting, not just because of how creative they can be, but because of the greater thought that has to be applied in order to understand or question the issue that is being brought up by the piece. All data visualization is interesting to me though, because it shows the great amount, or lack of care that went into presenting data and making it readable or more abstract for audiences to determine their own opinions.
